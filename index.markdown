		<p>I'm a Stanford MBA student and Harvard alum.</p>
	    <p> Before starting at Stanford, I spent six years as a strategy consultant for biopharma and diagnostics companies. Together, we invested in and commercialized innovative therapies and tools. From my office in Switzerland, I worked with clients across the US, Europe, LatAm, Middle East, and Asia. </p>
	    <p>I care deeply about leadership, team dynamics, and cross-cultural inclusion. When not working, you’ll find me hiking, eating delicious home-cooked meals, or cheering for the Stanford women’s basketball squad. </p>
