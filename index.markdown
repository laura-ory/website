		<p>I’m a strategy consultant with <a href='https://healthadvances.com/' target="_blank">Health Advances</a>, where I primarily work with biopharma and diagnostics companies. Together, we invest in and commercialize innovative therapies and tools. From my office in Switzerland, I work with clients across the US, Europe, LatAm, Middle East, and Asia.</p>
		<p>I recently graduated with an MBA from Stanford as an <a href='https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/experience/news-history/commencement/certificate-award-recipients' target="_blank">Arjay Miller</a> scholar. I also graduated magna cum laude for my undergraduate studies in chemistry and physics at Harvard.</p>
		<p>I care deeply about leadership, team dynamics, and cross-cultural inclusion. When not working, you’ll find me hiking, eating delicious home-cooked meals, or cheering for women's sports.</p>
